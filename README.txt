The objective of the game is to make your way through all five levels.

Your player is the blue cube. To get to the next level, you must get a certain numberof points.

You get points by killing enemies, which are represented by red spheres.
If you get hit by one of the enemies, you lose.
After each level, your game is automatically saved, so when you die, you can either start a new game, or load the game from the last level you 
were on. Once you beat level 5, you win.
